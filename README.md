# Andrew Messer's Portfolio

## Andrew's professional portfolio created with React.js and styled with Bootstrap

This is my professional coding portfolio that I will use to track my career progression and show to potenial employers.

- I needed a portfolio to show potential employers what I can do.
- This will allow me to update my resume and portfolio projects as I advance in my software engineering career.
- I'm able to add this portfolio to my career search materials and allow me to prove to potential employers what I'm capable of.
- I learned how to implement a single page application by using the React.js library to build individual componenets to be displayed in the main content container.

## You can view my Portfolio from the link below, no installation required.
